    Creating and playing your own quizzes is a cool, competitive way to get everyone engaged. Take it in turns in your household to swap “questionmasters” and ask your questions to the rest of the group. Below are some suggestions to get you started

      <h1>Getting Setup</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        Don´t make your questions too difficult. The aim is to have fun so add in some elements of randomness by including purely chance elements such as “the youngest player gains 2 points”, or multiple choice questions that are sufficiently hard that they´re almost random “(what´s the population of Argentina, A, B, C?).
        <br></br>
        Tailor your questions to your group. If you have a lot of music fans, consider adding some guess-the-into rounds, if your group is mostly movie buffs, consider adding some guess-the-quote rounds.

        <p>Don´t take it too seriously, it´s supposed to be a bit of fun. Sticking to pop culture, current affairs, and interesting local facts are all good way to make sure that everyone can participate and have fun. Having too many serious questions about dry subject can make the quiz feel slower.</p>

        Here are some examples to get you started: 
        <ul>
          <li>Guess the famous face– Find a paparazzi photo of a celebrity trying to look incognito and have your players guess who it is</li>
          <li>Guess the ages – Guess the ages of you favourite celebrities. Does anyone really know how old Meryl Streep is?</li>
          <li>Observation – Add some quirky elements, for example, how many photographs are there on each floor of the house?</li>
          <li>Guess the theme tune – Play the first 5-10 seconds of the theme song from a TV series and have your players guess.</li>
          <li>First line of a book – Read the first line of a book to your players and guess which book.</li>
        </ul>
        Writing around 20-30 questions split into three rounds should take around 45 minutes to complete. Adding in drinks breaks between rounds can stretch this out to a full hour of entertainment.
